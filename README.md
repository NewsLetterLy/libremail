# LibreMail

This project encompasses three parts:

1. JavaScript-less HTML Email Client
2. Kanban-style Email Client
3. IMAP to SQL Syncing Engine

All of which are licensed under the GNU GPLv3. The goal of this project is to
provide a fully free, modern, and extremely usable email client as well as an
easy to use tool for storing your remote email in a local SQL database.

Additionally, I set out to create a Kanban-style email client to interact with
your email in a much more intuitive card-based interface.

Currently parts 1 and 3 are under active development, with part 2 coming later.
Read below for more information about each application.
